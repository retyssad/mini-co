"""Core agent loop.

This is the heart of CoreCoder.  The pattern is simple:

    user message -> LLM (with tools) -> tool calls? -> execute -> loop
                                      -> text reply? -> return to user

It keeps looping until the LLM responds with plain text (no tool calls),
which means it's done working and ready to report back.
